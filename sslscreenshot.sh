#sslscreenshot by Robert Craig 
#Searches for files named <blank>sslscan and screenshots them. These files are put into a folder called SSLScreenshots. Check out the main eptscript if you are wondering about how to get the files. 
#The methodology is somewhat primitive, but it works. 
#
mkdir "SSLScreenshots"
sslscans=$(find *sslscan) #creates a list of the sslscan files and  puts it into a variable
#
for i in $sslscans

	if [ "$linecount" -gt 50 ]              	#check to see if the line count in the file is greater than 50. That's about a full screen in the terminal at regular view.
